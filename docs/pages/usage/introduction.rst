Introduction
############
This is the documentation for the Signatory package, which provides facilities for calculating the signature and logsignature transforms of streams of data.

If you want to know more about the mathematics of the signature transform and how to use it then see :ref:`understanding-whataresignatures` for a very brief introduction. Further links to papers discussing the subject in more detail can also be found there.

If you want to get started on using the signature transform in your code then :func:`signatory.signature` is probably the place to start! It includes a lot of arguments but you won't need most of them to get started. Check out the examples (for example :ref:`examples-simple`) to some simple demonstrations.

If you have any comments or queries about signatures or about this package (for example, bug reports or feature requests) then open an issue on `GitHub <https://github.com/patrick-kidger/signatory>`__.
