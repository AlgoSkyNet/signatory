Installation
############
Available for Python 2.7, Python 3.5, Python 3.6, Python 3.7.

Requires `PyTorch <http://pytorch.org/>`__. Tested with PyTorch version 1.2.0, but should work with all recent versions.

Install via ``pip install signatory`` or ``pip3 install signatory`` as appropriate.

Only source distributions are available at the moment, so you will need to be able to compile C++. If you are on Linux then this should automatically happen when you run ``pip``. Other operating systems may vary.
