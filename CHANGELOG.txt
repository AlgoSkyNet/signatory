1.1.0
-----
Should now typically run even faster on typical batch sizes.
Worked around a major memory leak due to PyTorch bug 25340.
Worked around a minor issue (backwards operations silently failing if in-place operations are applied to the output of signature or logsignature), which was caused due to PyTorch bug 24413.

1.0.0
-----
Added logsignatures. (No small feat!)
Added to the documentation.
Added utilities for computing Lyndon words and Lyndon brackets.

0.2.0
-----
Rewrote to compute the signature exactly, rather than its Riemann approximation.
Added better documentation, examples, and tests.

0.1.2
-----
Added support for Python 2.7.
New documentation: examples, and using py2annotate to generate type annotations.
Added lots of testing with the very poor man's makefile-equivalent of CI.

0.1.1
-----
Bugfixes for edge cases.
Some documentation fixes.
Added tests.

0.1.0
-----
Initial release!
